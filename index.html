            <h3>Career Summary</h3>
            <p>
              Welcome and thank you for veiwing my career portfolio. I wish I
              could tell you, that I have got extensive experience as a full stack web
              developer and I'm the best in the business. Yeah, that would be a
              lie, What is not a lie however is that, I am still very early in my
              career as a software and web developer, I have just complete my diploma in 
              information technology at University and I have obtained better results.
              I do not have much industry experience but I have developed amazing projects
               through "hands-on" approach and commitment in school and in my personal projects.

              <i>This was a school project that I developed in 2021. This is an online learning system
                that allows the teachers or lectures to create one to three tests for their students. The
                students are allowed to take one test at a time and each student is graded at the end of each
                test. <br><br>
                This system was created using java programming language, it was developed using the latest
                version of Netbeans. It allows the users such as lectures and students to register and login to
                the system. Lectures and Students have separate user panels, with different interfaces and functions.
                Lectures are able to setup the test including dates, questions, marks and duration of the test.
                Students are allowed to select the test and write the test. The test has a time limite the decreases
                the test is being taken and the test automatically submits the answered question when
                the time is finished. The test allows the student to preview their marks and to also preview
                the correct and incorrect answers.

                Managers are able to setup the store including registering new employees, adding and removing products, 
                increasing and decreasing prices, discounts and adding supplier information. They have an additional feature
                that enables them to view sales of the store and also according to which stuff memeber was at the cash register.

                Stuff are allowed to login to the system and make sales. The system allows the stuff to make sales and return sales. 
                They are also allowed to capture customer details for orders made and they are able to edit that captured information.
                The system allows the stuff member to view all the sales and slips that they have made at the store.

              >This was a school project that I developed in 2021. This is a dice rolling game that basically allows a user to play agianst
              the computer. The user rolls 5 dices by clicking the play button displayed on screen, after clicking the button, the game then rolls 
              the dices for the user and automatically rolls 5 dices again for the computer. The winner is decided on the hierarchy of the die values
              for example 6 of a kind, beats 5 of a kind. If both the players have the same combinationof dice, the highest values wins, for example
              two 4's beats two 3's. The score is displayed after each dice roll on the top of the left and right side of the screen. <br><br>
              The game was developed using C# programming language, it was created using Visual Studio 2017 version. I used alot of graphics such as images 
              and audio to make it more like the casino gambling games. The audio was mastered using the A.I skill which monitors the movements of the players
              during the game.
